verletPygame
============

Verlet integration scheme for a deformable object using a mesh-based Mass Spring System. This has almost just been written to test pygame and to experiment with different parameters like collision relaxation iterations or the stiffness coefficient.

You can pick one of the mass points of the object with your mouse. 

Requires
--------
* pygame
* numpy

Usage
-----
	python verletPygame.py

Todo
----
* Collision detection and handling between multiple objects
* Shape matching
* Pressure
